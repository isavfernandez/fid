<h1>Gallery</h1>

<p>Not only is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>

<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" width="200" height="200"></a><br> We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burger.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="close-up of burger" width="200" height="200"></a><br>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics.</p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fish" width="200" height="200"></a><br>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>
    
<h2>Southern Fried Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fried chicken" width="200" height="200"></a><br>Fried chicken from the dirty south. The best yard bird around. Why have a pet when you can have good old southern fried chicken.</p>

<h2>Fries not from the french</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fries with a side of ketchup" width="200" height="200"></a><br>What more can you ask for, fried slices of potatos dipped in the slaughtered remains of a tomato.</p>

<h2>Tabouleh not grass</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="close-up of tabouleh" width="200" height="200"></a><br>We dont even know what this is. It could be grass or it could be horse feed, either ways is a wonderful delight to the pallet.</p>
