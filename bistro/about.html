<h1>About the Chef </h1>

<p>The recipes listed on our home page are those that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i></p>

<p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.</p>
